This goes to my family, especially my mom and dad, for providing me with the most sincere and unconditional support and belief I could have ever received. To every friend who stood there when things felt overwhelming. Also to every professor and mentor who generously shared their knowledge and advice.
\\

A special thanks goes to Professor Fernando Cristancho for introducing me to an extremely nurturing working environment, filled with people without whom this could never have come to pass. I am also deeply grateful to Professor Spencer N. Axani, for opening the doors to not only his lab but also to immensely rewarding experiences and knowledge I will carry with me forever.
\\

Last but not least I want to thank me for believing in me, I want to thank me for doing all this hard work, for never quitting and for being me at all times.
