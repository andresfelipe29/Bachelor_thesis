This goes to my family, especially to my parents, for providing me with the most sincere and unconditional support I could have ever received. To every friend who stood there when things felt overwhelming and gave me the courage to keep going. Also to every professor and mentor who generously shared their knowledge and advice.
\\

A special thanks goes to Professor Fernando Cristancho for introducing me to an extremely nurturing working environment, filled with people without whom this could never have come to be. I am also deeply grateful to Professor Spencer N. Axani, for opening the doors to not only his group but also to immensely rewarding experiences and knowledge I will carry with me forever.
\\

Last but not least I want to thank me for believing in me, I want to thank me for doing all this hard work, for never quitting and for being me at all times.
