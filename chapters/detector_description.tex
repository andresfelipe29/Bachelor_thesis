\section{3D printed case}

In order to make the crystal easier to mount on the SiPM PCB it was necessary to design a 3D printed case. With this we made sure that the crystal would not move with respect to the SiPM, preventing scratches and providing a more stable optical coupling with the photomultiplier.

The design keeps in mind that the crystal has to be wrapped in teflon tape to increase reflectivity, which is why it comes in two pieces that come together around the crystal, lowering the risk of tears. Once the crystal is placed in the case it can be kept together by means of electrical tape.
