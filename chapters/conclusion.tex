\chapter{Conclusion}

CosmicWatch: The Desktop Muon Detectors show promising potential in gamma spectroscopy. The integration of Silicon photomultipliers with LYSO crystals represents a promising combination. Despite technical challenges, it was proven that the detector is capable of resolving peaks, this progress was achieved through meticulous optimizations in hardware and programming, marking a substantial advancement towards a fully functional gamma spectrometer. The enhancements to CosmicWatch were obtained while remaining affordable and user-friendly, aligning with our primary goal of keeping science available to students, educators, researchers, and enthusiasts alike, inviting them to delve into the world of particle and nuclear physics, electronics, programming, and data analysis. Furthermore, we outline plausible paths to build upon our work and encourage CosmicWatch users to use these materials as a stepping stone to further contribute to the project.
